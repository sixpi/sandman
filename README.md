[Sandman documentation](https://sandman.readthedocs.org/en/latest/)

**sandman** "makes things REST". Have an existing database you'd like to expose via
a REST API? Normally, you'd have to write a ton of boilerplate code for
the ORM you're using, then integrate that into some web framework. 

I don't want to write boilerplate.

Here's what's required to create a RESTful API service from an existing database using
**sandman**:

```python
from sandman import app, db

app.config['SQLALCHEMY_DATABASE_URI'] = 'sqlite:///chinook'

from sandman.model import register, Model

class Artist(Model):
    __tablename__ = 'Artist'

class Album(Model):
    __tablename__ = 'Album'

class Playlist(Model):
    __tablename__ = 'Playlist'

register((Artist, Album, Playlist))

app.run()
```

Let's start our new service and make a request:

```zsh
> python runserver.py &
* Running on http://127.0.0.1:5000/

> curl GET http://localhost:5000/artists
```

```json
...
{
    "ArtistId": 273,
    "Name": "C. Monteverdi, Nigel Rogers - Chiaroscuro; London Baroque; London Cornett & Sackbu",
    "links": [
    {
        "rel": "self",
        "uri": "/artists/ArtistId"
    }
    ]
},
{
    "ArtistId": 274,
    "Name": "Nash Ensemble",
    "links": [
    {
        "rel": "self",
        "uri": "/artists/ArtistId"
    }
    ]
},
{
    "ArtistId": 275,
    "Name": "Philip Glass Ensemble",
    "links": [
    {
        "rel": "self",
        "uri": "/artists/ArtistId"
    }
    ]
}
]
```

Oh, that's not enough? You also want a Django-style admin interface built
automatically? Fine. Add one more line to the list of models to get access to
this:

With **sandman**, (almost) zero boilerplate code is required. Your existing database
structure and schema is introspected and your database tables magically get a
RESTful API and admin interface. For each table, Sandman creates:

* proper endpoints 
* support for a configurable set of HTTP verbs 
    * GET
    * POST
    * PATCH
    * PUT
    * DELETE
* responses with appropriate `rel` links automatically
* custom validation by simply defining `validate_<METHOD>` methods on your Model
* explicitly list supported methods for a Model by setting the `__methods__` attribute
* customize a Models endpoint by setting the `__endpoint__` method
* essentially a HATEOAS-based service sitting in front of your database

*Warning: Sandman is still very much a work in progress. Use it at your own risk. 
It's also often changing in backwards incompatible ways.*

### Installation

`pip install sandman`

### Quickstart

You'll need to create one file with the following contents (which I call `runserver.py`):

```python
from sandman.model import register, Model

# Insert Models here
# Register models here 
# register((Model1, Model2, Model3)) 
# or
# register(Model1)
# register(Model2)
# register(Model3)

from sandman import app, db
app.config['SQLALCHEMY_DATABASE_URI'] = '<your database connection string (using SQLAlchemy)>'
app.run()
```

Then simply run 

```bash
python runserver.py
```

and try curling your new RESTful API!

### Example Application

Take a look in the `sandman/test` directory. The application found there makes
use of the [Chinook](http://chinookdatabase.codeplex.com) sample SQL database.

### Coming Soon

* Authentication
* More `links` automatically generated (i.e. `links` to related objects)
